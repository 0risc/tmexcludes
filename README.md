## `tmexcludes` - Manage Time Machine exclusions! ðŸ”„

Fast, light [macOS] utility that shows, backups and restores
the list of excludes in [Time Machine]'s System Preferences.

## Motivation

Thse excluded paths are stored in
`/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist` within the `SkipPaths`
array. Running a basic `cp` and `mv` on the `.plist` file can take care of
backing up and restoring these settings.

[`tmexcludes`] was made to extract and manage these exclusions, making it
easier to perofrm intermediate steps. With this in mind, one could, let's
say, automate certain tasks on specific folders if they are in present in
the list. This utility streamlines the overall process, making easier to
maintain consistent settings across [macOS] installations.

## Highlights

- ðŸš€ _**Fast**_ - minimal overhead, [tmexcludes.sh][`tmexcludes`]
  only adds ~ `2.5 ms` of overhead.[^hyperfine]
- ðŸŽ¨ _**Intuitive**_ - user-friendly, clear way to export and restore
  excluded [Time Machine] paths.
- ðŸ”’ _**Robust**_ - ensures that the format passed to `defaults read` is a
  proper array.
- ðŸ“¦ _**Self-contained**_ - no dependencies, lightweight, uses POSIX `sh`,
  `awk` (e.g. `1586 bytes`, `91 lines`).
